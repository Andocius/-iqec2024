      <p><strong>About Rebecca Gyumi:</strong></p>
      <p>Rebecca Gyumi is a Tanzanian girls' rights activist and lawyer renowned for her tireless advocacy to end child marriage in Tanzania. She is the Founder and Executive Director of the <strong>Msichana Initiative</strong>, a non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting girls' access to education and empowerment.</p>
      
      <p>In 2016, Rebecca made a significant impact by filing a petition to challenge Tanzania’s <strong>Marriage Act of 1971</strong>, which permitted girls as young as 14 to marry with parental consent. Her efforts culminated in a landmark ruling in 2019, when the Court of Appeal ruled in her favor and mandated that the Government amend the law to raise the minimum marriage age to 18 for both boys and girls.</p>
      
      <p>Rebecca's work has gained widespread recognition, earning her the prestigious <strong>2018 UN Human Rights Prize</strong> and a spot in the <strong>2019 Most Influential People in Global Policy</strong>. She remains committed to advocating for girls’ rights to education and continues her work to end child marriage in Tanzania and beyond.</p>
